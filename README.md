# Uvik Python training pre-interview tasks

### Hey, this is initial pre-interview check of your skills!

You'll need to create a GIT repository (Github/Gitlab) and complete 2 simple tasks we've prepared for you:

* [Data aggregation](task_1)
* [Simple TODO app](task_2)

Please mirror the structure of this repository:
```
│   LICENSE
│   README.md
│
├───task_1
│       data.csv
│       solution.py
│
└───task_2
        solution.py
```
Also, follow the [GIT Flow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) guidelines in your repository.
1. There should be a separate branch for each task
2. A PULL request should be created for each branch into main/master
3. Merge the PULL request
